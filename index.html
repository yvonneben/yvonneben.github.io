                        I used to call myself a sunset chaser. Now the 'sunset' does not necesarily to be 'sunset', it can be anything that I am passionate about or wanting to acheive in my life.<br>
                        When I was living in Scotland, I almost went to see the sunset everyday. It was one of most happiest time period in my life as I feel I was chasing for what I was wanting from the bottom of my heart. <br>
                        I hope I can have the similar passion for my current life and always be authentic, and honest to my own feelings and desires.<br><br>
